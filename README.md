How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery

I built this by having 1 input with 3 butons. when you enter a value into the input you have an option of placing that value (student's name) into a tardy list or a present list. Withe the javascript I used 3 click functions that called
3 more function that allows you to show or hide those lists. Which is usfully to the user so that students can't see other students who are on the tardy lists.

Lessons Learned:
I learned that appendeding to list can be difficult when the list items repeat after you run the function again. If you look in my js file you will see I used a jquery method $('li').remove() to fix that problem.If I had time to go to this I would try to see if I can edit and remove names on the lists.
